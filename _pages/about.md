## Interests  

My research interests are in programming languages and computer security. I aim to improve developer productivity and software quality through new software tools and languages.
I am particularly interested in using techniques from programming languages to make systems more secure and reliable. Lately, I have been focusing on finding and repairing security bugs in softwares automatically. 


Programming Languages and Formal Methods, Computer Security, Software Engineering

My research focus is on using techniques from programming languages to make systems more secure. Lately, I have been focusing on finding security bugs in softwares automatically. I am also interested in automatically repairing security vulnerabilities. I am also interested in data driven security and security issues in deep learning, such as adversarial example and imitation attack.

I am using techniques from programming languages to make systems more secure.  
Lately, I have been focusing on finding security bugs in software using symbolic execution and static analysis.  
I am also interested in automatically repairing security vulnerabilities, and for this purpose, I am keen to program synthesis technologies.  
I am also interested in security issues in deep learning, such as adversarial example and imitation attack.
