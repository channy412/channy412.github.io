## Interests  
I am using techniques from programming languages to make systems more secure.  
Lately, I have been focusing on finding security bugs in software using symbolic execution and static analysis.  
I am also interested in automatically repairing security vulnerabilities, and for this purpose, I am keen to program synthesis technologies.  
I am also interested in security issues in deep learning, such as adversarial example and imitation attack.   


* Beautiful, minimal design
