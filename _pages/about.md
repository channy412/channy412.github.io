## Interests  

My research interests are in programming languages and computer security. I aim to improve developer productivity and software quality through new software tools and languages.
I am particularly interested in using techniques from programming languages to make systems more secure and reliable. Lately, I have been focusing on finding and repairing security bugs in software automatically.
