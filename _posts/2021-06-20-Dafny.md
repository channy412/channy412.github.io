A Dafny program is internally translated into Boogie(intermediate verification language). It is subsequently translated into first-order conditions, which can be verified using Z3. It was intersting that there are intermediate verification languages, which are analogous to LLVM IR.

For more information, please refer to the Dafny paper.
