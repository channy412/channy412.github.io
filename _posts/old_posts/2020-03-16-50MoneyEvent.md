(Korean Book; Title: 50대 사건으로 보는 돈의 역사, Author: 홍춘욱 )

The corona virus and the plumage of oil price is damaging the global economy. I believe that I should rely on the history to predict the future. This is the main reason I read this book. 


This book overviews the world history from the eyes of an economist. It starts by reviewing the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

>Since the Glorious Revolution, Parliament’s power in Britain has continued to increase, while the monarchy’s influence has waned.

The author points out that this made harder for the new king to manipulate the nation’s economy. This offered stability to England, which dragged down the bond interest rate.

It is suprising that the stability generated by Glorious Revolution set the foundation for the largest hub of the world’s economy.

This book covers lots of significant events, and I enjoyed reading this book.
